## Differences from joax/fw-fanctrl-gnome-shell-extension

This extension is spiritual successor to, and inspired by,
[joax/fw-fanctrl-gnome-shell-extension](https://github.com/joax/fw-fanctrl-gnome-shell-extension)
as the author was unfortunately unavailable. The differences we currently have
is supporting Gnome 47+, and the control is in quick settings rather than the
top bar for now.
